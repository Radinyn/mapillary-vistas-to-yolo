[Mapillary Vistas](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas) is a very detailed street imagery dataset.

This script converts it into ready-to-use YOLO format. I made it for the sake of my past projects and thought that someone mind find it useful.

In `config.yaml` you can setup converting the complex segmentation labels to simpler ones that are more suited for your project.
